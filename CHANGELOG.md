# RelishEconomy Changelog

## Version 1.0.2-Beta (January 23, 2026)

### 🛒 **Multi-Currency Shop Support**

This update adds full multi-currency support to the shop system, making it consistent with the sell functionality.

### ✨ **New Features**
- **Per-Item Shop Currencies** - Shop now uses the same currency system as selling
- **Dynamic Currency Display** - Each item shows its price with the correct currency symbol
- **Consistent Currency Logic** - Shop and sell systems now work identically
- **Automatic Currency Detection** - Items automatically use their configured currency from `prices.yml`

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**
- **ShopManager.java** - `getBuyCurrency(Material)` now returns per-item currencies
- **ShopGUI.java** - Updated to display and handle multiple currencies per item
- **ShopGUIListener.java** - Purchase transactions now use item-specific currencies
- **Balance Display** - Shows default currency balance (since multiple currencies can't be shown at once)

### 📝 **Configuration Updates**
- **shop.yml** - `buy-currency` setting is now deprecated (marked with comments)
- **Documentation** - Updated to reflect new multi-currency shop behavior
- **README.md** - Added deprecation notice for old shop currency setting

### 🎯 **How It Works**
```yaml
# In prices.yml
prices:
  STONE: 0.5                    # Uses default currency (dollars) - shop shows $1.00
  DIAMOND: 
    price: 100
    currency: "coins"           # Shop shows ◎200 (with 2.0x multiplier)
  EMERALD:
    price: 150  
    currency: "gems"            # Shop shows with gems symbol
```

### 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Single-currency setups remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 📋 **Migration Notes**
- The `buy-currency` setting in `shop.yml` is now ignored
- Shop items automatically use their currency from `prices.yml`
- No manual configuration changes required
