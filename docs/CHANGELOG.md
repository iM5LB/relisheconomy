---

## Version 1.0.5-Beta (February 16, 2026)

### 🔧 Fixed
- Towny bank deposit issue where `/t deposit <amount>` could take player money but town bank stayed at `$0`.
- Updated Towny/Vault economy flow so town bank balances now update correctly after deposits.

### ⚙️ **Configuration Updates**
- Added specific configuration options:
  - shop.yml -> `shop.enabled: true` (default)

- Improved config synchronization so missing keys are added while keeping existing values.
- No structural config move is required for existing server files.

### 🧩 **Config Updater Improvements**
- Extended updater coverage beyond `config.yml`:
  - `shop.yml`
  - `prices.yml`
  - `gui.yml`
  - `lang/*.yml`
- Preserves existing values and only injects missing keys.

### 💾 **Backup Behavior**
- Backup files remain in the same directory as the source file.
- Updated backup naming format for clarity:
  - `<name>-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.ext`
  - Collision-safe suffixes are appended when needed.

### 📊 **Metrics (bStats)**
- Added bStats integration.
- Added config toggle:
  - `metrics.enabled: true` (default)

---

## Version 1.0.4-Beta (February 15, 2026)

### 🔌 **Towny + Vault Compatibility**
- Added `loadbefore: [Towny]` in `plugin.yml` to improve startup ordering
- Improved Vault hook reliability:
  - Checks that Vault is enabled before registering provider
  - Re-registers safely if already hooked
  - Added startup retry hook attempts when Vault is late to initialize
- Added clearer startup logging for Vault provider registration

### 🏦 **Bank Account Support for Town/Nation Economy**
- Implemented full Vault bank API behavior for non-player accounts
- Added deterministic internal bank account IDs (name-based UUIDs) for stable persistence
- Enabled `hasBankSupport()` for proper Towny bank operations
- Added bank operations:
  - `createBank`, `deleteBank`, `bankBalance`, `bankHas`, `bankDeposit`, `bankWithdraw`
  - `isBankOwner`, `isBankMember`

### 🧩 **PlaceholderAPI Improvements**
- Fixed player placeholder requests failing for online/new accounts
- Improved placeholder parsing and compatibility:
  - Added leaderboard aliases: `leaderboard` and `top` (mapped to `baltop`)
  - Added formatted balance aliases via `balance_formatted`
- Improved raw balance output formatting:
  - Respects currency decimal settings
  - Uses stable locale formatting for numeric placeholders
- Prevented blank leaderboard placeholder outputs on cold cache/invalid positions by returning safe fallback values

### 📘 **Documentation**
- Updated `docs/PlaceholderAPI.md` with new alias placeholders and behavior notes
- Updated troubleshooting notes for placeholder account handling

---

## Version 1.0.3-Beta (February 10, 2026)

### 📝 **Documentation**
- **Complete Documentation Overhaul** - Fully updated documentation website
  - More clear and detailed information
  - Improved structure and navigation
  - Enhanced examples and guides
  - Better coverage of all features

### 🔄 **Real-Time Read Behavior**
- Background polling checks for external DB changes
- Only refreshes full balance data when `last_modified` changes
- Optimal for Discord/Web integrations that update balances out-of-band

*You need to replace Real-Time Sync with new config*
```yaml
database:
  # Real-time read mode (read from DB when balances change externally)
  # Recommended: true only if you manually edit DB and need instant visibility
  real-time-read: false
```

## Version 1.0.2-Beta (January 23, 2026)

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes**
- **New Player Balance** - Fixed issue where new players had their balance set instead of added to
  - Starting balance is now added to existing balance instead of overwriting it
  - Prevents accidental balance resets for returning players
  - Maintains proper balance accumulation across sessions

### 🛒 **Multi-Currency Shop Support**

This update adds full multi-currency support to the shop system, making it consistent with the sell functionality.
---

### ✨ **New Features**

- **Documentation** - Updated to reflect new multi-currency shop behavior
- **README.md** - Added deprecation notice for old shop currency setting

### 🎯 **How It Works**
```yaml
# In prices.yml
prices:
  STONE: 0.5                    # Uses default currency (dollars) - shop shows $1.00
  DIAMOND: 
    price: 100
    currency: "coins"           # Shop shows ◎200 (with 2.0x multiplier)
  EMERALD:
    price: 150  
    currency: "gems"            # Shop shows with gems symbol
```

### 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Single-currency setups remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 📋 **Migration Notes**
- The `buy-currency` setting in `shop.yml` is now ignored
