# RelishEconomy Changelog

## Version 1.0.9-Beta (March 10, 2026)

This release is a large shop/GUI + configuration update, plus expanded physical currency customization and a safer config updater.

### **Added**
- SmartSpawner + Vault economy provider compatibility (SmartSpawner can use RelishEconomy as the economy)
- Shop favorites system:
  - `favorites.yml` storage
  - Favorites button in shop GUI and a dedicated Favorites category view
  - Favorite state messages: `shop.favorites.added`, `shop.favorites.removed`
  - Favorite items can render with a glow effect in the shop list
- New purchase flow GUI (Premium):
  - Clicking an item opens a buy GUI where players can increase/decrease quantity
  - Confirm purchase, cancel/back returns to the same category page
  - Favorite toggle from the purchase GUI
  - Confirm button can show player balance in its lore (configurable in `gui.yml`)
- `show-unpriced-items` option for shop browsing:
  - When enabled, items without a configured buy price can be shown as disabled instead of hidden
- Physical currency enhancements (per currency):
  - Optional crafting recipe support
  - Custom model data support for currency items
  - More customization options for physical currency item templates (material, name, lore, visual flags)
- Improved config restoration/merging (config updater):
  - Automatically restores missing bundled files: `config.yml`, `shop.yml`, `prices.yml`, `gui.yml`, `lang/en.yml`, `lang/ar.yml`, `lang/pt.yml`
  - Merges missing keys into existing YAML without wiping server edits
  - Automatic backups: `<file>-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.ext`

### **Changed**
- Shop layout and defaults were reworked to match Creative inventory categories more closely (order, grouping, and paging).
- Operator/utility category is disabled by default in the bundled shop configuration.
- GUI sorting markers are configurable (set active/inactive symbols in `gui.yml`).
- `/re reload` now reloads GUI config, shop categories, and purchase flow state more reliably.
- Placeholder formatting adjustments:
  - Compact/plain formatted placeholders no longer force currency symbols when using the plain variants (use the symbol-specific placeholder for symbols).

### Fixed
- Many "invalid shop item key/material" warnings by hardening material/key parsing and validation for modern Minecraft versions.
- Premium command registration and tab-completion reliability after `/re reload` when license state is active.
- PlaceholderAPI rank placeholders no longer degrade to `N/A` after server uptime (baltop cache refresh + safer fallbacks).

### Documentation
- Updated plugin documentation pages to match the current 1.0.9 shop/GUI and currency features.
- Updated the repository `README.md` and docs site pages, and added/embedded screenshots from `docs/assets/`.

### **Notes**
- This update touches multiple configs. If you want to fully reset to defaults, you can delete the plugin config folder and restart; the config updater will recreate missing files and back up invalid ones.
- Some fixes listed above were done during development while implementing the new features, and are included in this release.

---

### Fixed
- Improved command registration handling for licensed and disabled features.
- Improved reload/restart behavior so feature-based commands update more reliably.
- General stability improvements around command availability checks.

---

## Version 1.0.5-Beta (February 16, 2026)

### Fixed
- Towny bank deposit issue where `/t deposit <amount>` could take player money but town bank stayed at `$0`.
- Updated Towny/Vault economy flow so town bank balances now update correctly after deposits.

### **Configuration Updates**
- Added specific configuration options:
  - shop.yml -> `shop.enabled: true` (default)
  - prices.yml -> `sell.enabled: true` (default)
- Improved config synchronization so missing keys are added while keeping existing values.
- No structural config move is required for existing server files.

### **Config Updater Improvements**
- Extended updater coverage beyond `config.yml`:
  - `shop.yml`
  - `prices.yml`
  - `gui.yml`
  - `lang/*.yml`
- Preserves existing values and only injects missing keys.

### **Backup Behavior**
- Backup files remain in the same directory as the source file.
- Updated backup naming format for clarity:
  - `<name>-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.ext`
  - Collision-safe suffixes are appended when needed.

### **Metrics (bStats)**
- Added bStats integration.
- Added config toggle:
  - `metrics.enabled: true` (default)

---

## Version 1.0.4-Beta (February 15, 2026)

### **Towny + Vault Compatibility**
- Added `loadbefore: [Towny]` in `plugin.yml` to improve startup ordering
- Improved Vault hook reliability:
  - Checks that Vault is enabled before registering provider
  - Re-registers safely if already hooked
  - Added startup retry hook attempts when Vault is late to initialize
- Added clearer startup logging for Vault provider registration

### **Bank Account Support for Town/Nation Economy**
- Implemented full Vault bank API behavior for non-player accounts
- Added deterministic internal bank account IDs (name-based UUIDs) for stable persistence
- Enabled `hasBankSupport()` for proper Towny bank operations
- Added bank operations:
  - `createBank`, `deleteBank`, `bankBalance`, `bankHas`, `bankDeposit`, `bankWithdraw`
  - `isBankOwner`, `isBankMember`

### **PlaceholderAPI Improvements**
- Fixed player placeholder requests failing for online/new accounts
- Improved placeholder parsing and compatibility:
  - Added leaderboard aliases: `leaderboard` and `top` (mapped to `baltop`)
  - Added formatted balance aliases via `balance_formatted`
- Improved raw balance output formatting:
  - Respects currency decimal settings
  - Uses stable locale formatting for numeric placeholders
- Prevented blank leaderboard placeholder outputs on cold cache/invalid positions by returning safe fallback values

### **Documentation**
- Updated `docs/PlaceholderAPI.md` with new alias placeholders and behavior notes
- Updated troubleshooting notes for placeholder account handling

---

## Version 1.0.3-Beta (February 10, 2026)

### **Documentation**
- **Complete Documentation Overhaul** - Fully updated documentation website
  - More clear and detailed information
  - Improved structure and navigation
  - Enhanced examples and guides
  - Better coverage of all features

### **Real-Time Read Behavior**
- Background polling checks for external DB changes
- Only refreshes full balance data when `last_modified` changes
- Optimal for Discord/Web integrations that update balances out-of-band

*You need to replace Real-Time Sync with new config*
```yaml
database:
  # Real-time read mode (read from DB when balances change externally)
  # Recommended: true only if you manually edit DB and need instant visibility
  real-time-read: false
```

---

## Version 1.0.2-Beta (January 23, 2026)

### **Bug Fixes**
- **New Player Balance** - Fixed issue where new players had their balance set instead of added to
  - Starting balance is now added to existing balance instead of overwriting it
  - Prevents accidental balance resets for returning players
  - Maintains proper balance accumulation across sessions

### **Multi-Currency Shop Support**

This update adds full multi-currency support to the shop system, making it consistent with the sell functionality.
---

### **New Features**
- **Per-Item Shop Currencies** - Shop now uses the same currency system as selling
- **Dynamic Currency Display** - Each item shows its price with the correct currency symbol

- **ShopGUI.java** - Updated to display and handle multiple currencies per item
- **ShopGUIListener.java** - Purchase transactions now use item-specific currencies
- **Balance Display** - Shows default currency balance (since multiple currencies can't be shown at once)

### **Configuration Updates**
- **shop.yml** - `buy-currency` setting is now deprecated (marked with comments)
- **Documentation** - Updated to reflect new multi-currency shop behavior
- **README.md** - Added deprecation notice for old shop currency setting

### **How It Works**
```yaml
# In prices.yml
prices:
  STONE: 0.5                    # Uses default currency (dollars) - shop shows $1.00
  DIAMOND: 
    price: 100
    currency: "coins"           # Shop shows ◎200 (with 2.0x multiplier)
  EMERALD:
    price: 150  
    currency: "gems"            # Shop shows with gems symbol
```

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Single-currency setups remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### **Migration Notes**
- The `buy-currency` setting in `shop.yml` is now ignored
- Shop items automatically use their currency from `prices.yml`
- No manual configuration changes required
