## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Currency Setup**
```yaml
currencies:
  dollars:
    name: "dollars"
    symbol: "$"
    display-name: "Dollars"
    color: "<green>"
    default: true
    starting-balance: 100.0
    payments-enabled: true
    permission: ""
    decimals-enabled: true
    exchange-rates:
      coins: 0.01
    physical-item:
      material: PAPER
      deposit-enabled: true
      withdraw-enabled: true
      name: "<green><bold>Dollar Bill"
      lore:
        - "<gray>Value: {formatted_amount}"
        - "<gray>Owner: <white>{owner}"
        - ""
        - "<yellow>Shift + Right-Click to deposit"
    crafting:
      enabled: false
      value: 100.0
      amount: 1

  coins:
    name: "coins"
    symbol: "◎"
    display-name: "Coins"
    color: "<gold>"
    default: false
    starting-balance: 50.0
    payments-enabled: true
    permission: ""
    decimals-enabled: false
    exchange-rates:
      dollars: 100.0
    physical-item:
      material: GOLD_NUGGET
      deposit-enabled: true
      withdraw-enabled: true
      name: "<gold><bold>Gold Coin"
      lore:
        - "<gray>Value: {formatted_amount}"
        - "<gray>Owner: <white>{owner}"
        - ""
        - "<yellow>Shift + Right-Click to deposit"
    crafting:
      enabled: false
      value: 1.0
      amount: 1
```

Physical currency notes and coins keep the owner name in their item metadata. `/withdraw` sets the owner to the player, and crafted physical currency is rewritten to the crafting player as well.
